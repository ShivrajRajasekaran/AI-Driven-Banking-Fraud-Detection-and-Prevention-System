# **Project Report: AI-Driven Banking Fraud Detection and Prevention System**

## **1. Introduction**
The rapid expansion of digital banking has brought convenience to users but also opened the doors to an increasing number of fraudulent activities. This project focuses on developing an AI-driven banking system that detects and prevents fraud in real-time. The system integrates Generative AI for anomaly detection and Twilio for real-time phone verification, offering enhanced security to users. The project is deployed on IBM LinuxONE to ensure scalability and security.



## **2. Problem Statement**
### **2.1 Overview of Financial Fraud**
- With the rise of digital banking, fraudulent activities like unauthorized transactions, account takeovers, and data breaches have become more prevalent.
- Financial institutions often struggle with slow, manual verification processes and a lack of real-time fraud detection mechanisms.
  
### **2.2 Key Challenges**
- **Manual Verification**: Many systems rely on slow, inefficient manual processes to verify changes in sensitive data, which are not sufficient to prevent real-time fraud.
- **Delayed Notifications**: Users are often not notified immediately when their sensitive data is changed.
- **Lack of Predictive Analysis**: Traditional banking systems lack advanced predictive models to detect and prevent fraud before it occurs.

### **2.3 Objective**
- To design a real-time fraud detection system that alerts users immediately when suspicious activities or data changes occur, using AI and phone-based verification to prevent unauthorized access.



## **3. Solution**
### **3.1 AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**
- The system uses **Generative AI** to detect anomalies in transaction data, identifying potential fraudulent transactions by analyzing user behavior patterns in real-time.

### **3.2 Real-Time User Verification with Twilio**
- Integrated **Twilio API** for phone-based verification. When sensitive data like a userâ€™s email or phone number is altered, the system triggers a phone call to the user for confirmation. Users can confirm, deny, or block transactions based on their input.

### **3.3 Scalable and Secure Platform**
- Deployed the application on **IBM LinuxONE**, providing a secure, scalable environment that can handle large transaction volumes while maintaining data security.

### **3.4 Data Management**
- Initially attempted integration with **IBM Db2** for data management, but challenges with integration led to the use of **CSV-based databases** for storing user details and transaction history.



## **4. Methodology**
### **4.1 System Architecture**
1. **User Authentication and Transactions**:
   - Users sign up or log in to the banking application. The system manages user authentication using a CSV-based database.
   - Real-time transactions between users are facilitated, with AI monitoring all activities for anomalies.
   
2. **AI Monitoring**:
   - The system uses pre-trained **Generative AI** models to detect suspicious behavior and anomalous transaction patterns in real-time.

3. **Twilio Verification**:
   - If the AI detects an anomaly or a sensitive data change, the **Twilio API** sends a phone call to the user for verification, ensuring a secure process for updating data or authorizing transactions.

4. **Platform Deployment**:
   - The application is deployed on **IBM LinuxONE**, which ensures security, reliability, and scalability.

### **4.2 Data Flow**
- The application stores all user and transaction data in CSV files.
- Anomalies detected by the AI are logged, and a Twilio-triggered phone verification flow begins for immediate action.
